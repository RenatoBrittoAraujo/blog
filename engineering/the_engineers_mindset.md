## What is an engineer

Main character of this story is the engineer.

Engineer is well known for ingenuity
Engineer is known for his capability of making a solution where nobody else can spot it
Engineer is known for solving a problem permanently
Engineer is known to connect a breath of knowledge into a unique idea
Engineer is a hacker

## Psychology of the engineer

The engineer expresses creativity through the laws of nature
The engineer births ideas into reality
The engineer likes to build stuff
The engineer is good at editing, creating and destroying as he pleases
The engineer takes great joy from solving a problem
The engineer enjoys carrying an idea from cradle to production
The engineer is resourceable at finding experimental or documented information
The engineer obsess about efficiency
The engineer takes joy into noticing something is possible, when at first it looked crazy
The engineer likes to understand systems
The engineer is able to follow big logic chains
The engineer is naturally lazy, and wants to facilitate lazyness
The engineer writes requisites naturally
The engineer divides work naturally
The engineer does not shy away from the hard work
The engineer knows he's doing a good job because his will starts to believe it's becoming impossible, but intuition says it is possible
The engineer doesn't like down time

## What is NOT the engineer

The engineer should be capable of acting as a scientist, but he does not specialize on that.

- a scientist figures stuff out
- the engineer doesn't think all possibilities have been exausted yet

The engineer should be capable of acting as a businessman, but he does not specialize on that.

- a businessman converts ideas into institutions
- the engineer doesn't want an institution because it's not tidy enough

The engineer can interface with both scientist and businessman, turning what is potential into actual.

#### What makes an excelent engineer

***--> work in progress. if you don't agree, i'd love to understand why <--***

##### How to handle the problem?

- The bad engineer doesn't find any solution to the problem
- The good engineer finds a solution and implements it
- The excelent engineer figures out the problem has already been solved, and hands back the canned solution

##### How to solve the problem?

- The bad engineer say it's impossible
- The good engineer say it's possible, and starts working on it
- The excelent engineer notices a canned solution doesn't exist after extensive research, and starts working on it

##### What a solution should look like?

- The bad engineer finds a solution, but it "can't do X"
- The good engineer finds a solution that looks pretty
- The excelent engineer finds a solution that looks simple

##### How to validation solution?

- The bad engineer checks their solution to see if it works
- The good engineer checks various solutions to see why they wouldn't work
- The excelent engineer hates every solution, but chooses one 

##### How to manage multiple projects?

- The bad engineer hangs on tight to the same project
- The good engineer likes to start projects
- The excelent engineer take projects from start to finish

##### How to handle knowledge acquisition?

- The bad engineer avoid having to learn something new
- The good engineer targets learning where it's most needed
- The excelent engineer targets learning what he knows the least

##### How to handle mistakes?

- The bad engineer are defensive about their own mistakes
- The good engineer admits readly to any newly found mistake
- The excelent engineer consider all the project a mistake

##### How to plan?

- The bad engineer has rigid plans with certainty about outcomes
- The good engineer has flexible plans with satisfactory failsafes
- The excelent engineer's only plan is to do it fast and decide from there

##### How to handle quantity versus quality?

- The bad engineer doesn't consider the tradeoff of quality and quantity
- The good engineer carefully monitors the quality 
- The excelent engineer bursts with massive force in numbers

#### What are the engineer needs to consider

##### Precision restrictions:
- Will someone be hurt if my decision is wrong?
- Can sin be a consequence of a mistake I make now?

##### Time restrictions:
- How fast can it be done?
- By then, is it still useful?

##### Knowledge restrictions:
- What kind of knowledge do I need to consult?
- What am I considering to be easy? Why?
- What am I considering to be hard? Why?
- If there is a blindspot in the solution, where is it most likely at?

##### Manpower restrictions:
- Whose opinions about this would matter?
- How many man-hours does this need?
- Do I really have the time for this?
- Can I find trustworthy enough people to work on this?
- Do I know what I should say NO to?
- Am I capable of saying NO to people?

##### Resources restrictions:
- Do I have the resources in a timely manner for all steps in the process?
- What values the balance sheet would tell one month from now?
- What values the balance sheet would tell one year from now?
