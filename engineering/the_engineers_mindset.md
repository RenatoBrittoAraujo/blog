## What is an engineer

Main character of this story is the engineer.

Engineer is well known for ingenuity
Engineer is known for his capability of making a solution where nobody else can spot it
Engineer is known for solving a problem permanently
Engineer is known to connect a breath of knowledge into a unique idea
Engineer is a hacker

## Psychology of the engineer

The engineer expresses creativity through the laws of nature
The engineer births ideas into reality
The engineer likes to build stuff
The engineer is good at editing, creating and destroying as he pleases
The engineer takes great joy from solving a problem
The engineer enjoys carrying an idea from cradle to production
The engineer is resourceable at finding experimental or documented information
The engineer obsess about efficiency
The engineer takes joy into noticing something is possible, when at first it looked crazy
The engineer likes to understand systems
The engineer is able to follow big logic chains
The engineer is naturally lazy, and wants to facilitate lazyness
The engineer writes requisites naturally
The engineer divides work naturally
The engineer does not shy away from the hard work
The engineer knows he's doing a good job because his will starts to believe it's becoming impossible, but intuition says it is possible
The engineer doesn't like down time

## What is NOT the engineer

The engineer should be capable of acting as a scientist, but he does not specialize on that.

- a scientist figures stuff out - expands their body of knowledge without getting bogged down in practical applications
- the engineer doesn't think all possibilities have been exausted yet using the knowledge that already exists

The engineer should be capable of acting as a businessman, but he does not specialize on that.

- a businessman converts ideas into institutions
- the engineer doesn't want an institution because it's not tidy enough

The engineer can interface with both scientist and businessman, turning what is potential into actual.

#### What makes an excelent engineer

***--> work in progress. if you don't agree, i'd love to understand why <--***

##### How to handle the problem?

- The bad engineer doesn't find any solution to the problem
- The good engineer finds a solution and implements it
- The excelent engineer figures out the problem has already been solved, and hands back the canned solution

##### How to solve the problem?

- The bad engineer say it's impossible
- The good engineer say it's possible, and starts working on it
- The excelent engineer notices a canned solution doesn't exist after extensive research, and starts working on it

##### What a solution should look like?

- The bad engineer finds a solution, but it "can't do X"
- The good engineer finds a solution that looks pretty
- The excelent engineer finds a solution that looks simple

##### How to validation solution?

- The bad engineer checks their solution to see if it works
- The good engineer checks various solutions to see why they wouldn't work
- The excelent engineer hates every solution, but chooses one 

##### How to manage multiple projects?

- The bad engineer hangs on tight to the same project
- The good engineer likes to start projects
- The excelent engineer take projects from start to finish

##### How to handle knowledge acquisition?

- The bad engineer avoid having to learn something new
- The good engineer targets learning where it's most needed
- The excelent engineer targets learning what he knows the least

##### How to handle mistakes?

- The bad engineer are defensive about their own mistakes
- The good engineer admits readly to any newly found mistake
- The excelent engineer consider all the project a mistake

##### How to plan?

- The bad engineer has rigid plans with certainty about outcomes
- The good engineer has flexible plans with satisfactory failsafes
- The excelent engineer's only plan is to do it fast and decide from there

##### How to handle quantity versus quality?

- The bad engineer doesn't consider the tradeoff of quality and quantity
- The good engineer carefully monitors the quality 
- The excelent engineer bursts with massive force in numbers

#### What are the engineer needs to consider

##### Precision restrictions:
- Will someone be hurt if my decision is wrong?
- Can sin be a consequence of a mistake I make now?

##### Time restrictions:
- How fast can it be done?
- By then, is it still useful?

##### Knowledge restrictions:
- What kind of knowledge do I need to consult?
- What am I considering to be easy? Why?
- What am I considering to be hard? Why?
- If there is a blindspot in the solution, where is it most likely at?

##### Manpower restrictions:
- Whose opinions about this would matter?
- How many man-hours does this need?
- Do I really have the time for this?
- Can I find trustworthy enough people to work on this?
- Do I know what I should say NO to?
- Am I capable of saying NO to people?

##### Resources restrictions:
- Do I have the resources in a timely manner for all steps in the process?
- What values the balance sheet would tell one month from now?
- What values the balance sheet would tell one year from now?

#### Projects - A tree of problems

An actionable problem is a problem that can be solved over time by application of human effort now.

Each project can be depicted as a tree of steps. Each project solves one problem. There may be multiple projects that solve the same problem, but the tree of steps are different.

In the tree of problems, the leaves are actionable problems. Any remaining elements of the tree are not actionable due to the dependency on solution to actionable problem(s).

#### Engineer's Time 

Engineer's time can be categorized into:

- Standby mode - doing research, learning better ways of doing something, finding canned solutions to problems, integrating new knoledge, seeking new projects, exploring new ground

- Active mode - solving a defined and specific tree of problems to accomplish a goal, actively working on a leaf of this tree until it's subproblem is eliminated

The time of an engineer converts and compounds into their own growth:

- An engineer in standby mode only grows horizontally - can solve a whole new world of problems, but for each new problem his solutions are slow and of poor quality 

- An engineer in active mode only grows vertically - becomes better at building one specific thing

The effective engineer chooses strategically where to spend his human capital (or time) in order to accumulate the necessary knowledge to accomplish his projects of interest.

Each unique project requires a set of depth and breath of knowledge to solve its problem tree, therefore matching the engineer to the project requires effort in the form of active time and standby time.  

#### Team of Engineers

A big project could be accomplished faster (or just has more chance of being accomplished at all) if multiple engineers are involved.

For the talented engineer, their objective is to do everything alone. But this is not always possible or prefereable.

##### Engineer communication

Engineers are known for their dry, spartan, direct and simple communication.

The engineer composes their sentence with the simplest words possible to join all technical jargon it needs.

*a funny quirk of engineer communication is ocasional absence of adjectives, such as in this sentence*

Being in the trade of knowledge, the engineer tries to condense only crucial information in a natural language phrase, opting to use precise numbers whenever possible.

##### Engineers Hierarchy

When multiple engineer's work together, an organic hierarchy emerges.

Through verbal exchange, engineers place themselves and others along a value order for each subtree of problems in a project.

In a well balanced project, each engineer ends up owning a subtree of problems. One engineer owns the entire tree. The subtrees may overlap ownership. 

Each engineer works in their own node(s) of the tree, giving preference on a specific subproblem to the lowest ranking engineer within the hierarchy.

For a engineer which has other engineers within their own subtree, the solution to that subtree ceases from being a technical problem and becomes a people problem.

The higher raking engineer then helps the lower ranking engineer with informational inputs, and reminds him of the expected output of the subtree.
