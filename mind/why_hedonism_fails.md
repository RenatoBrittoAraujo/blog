# Scalable Happiness
#### *Or why hedonism fails*

<br/><br/>

Over the course of your life, you have noticed that some activities just bring more happiness than others. This is great, it means you can choose many paths for being happy. 

But not every path is the same. Some of your life choices were a shot in the foot. You would prefer to never have started doing certain things. They cause you to be unhappy in the long run.

The sum of your happiness over time doing some activity may be greater than some other activity.  

$$ \int_\mathit{today}^\infin happiness(action_1) > \int_\mathit{today}^\infin happiness(action_2) $$

An action that is happiness-scalable is any action you do today that gives you ‘compound interest’ for your happiness:
- You must be happy that you have done it today.
- You must be proud of it tomorrow.

The first constraint will ensure it will not drain you. You'll be satisfied and not striving for more. The anxiety of missing out, of having wasted your time, will cause impulsive behaviour. You may even double down on something you don't prefer, simply because switching would cause temporary lack of happiness. If you go to bed thinking about how today could have been much better, it's almost guaranteed that you will change interests tomorrow. If you change your interests every day, you have not actually found something you like.

And the second constraint is there to ensure that engaging some action in the past causes more satisfaction in the future. You'll find mirages. But if you chase it, you will get bored. If you have lived long enough, your sample size is good for you to determine what causes you to not be bored. What is the common thread that unites everything that made you happy before? If you found something that has consistently brough you happiness, and if what you did today will make you even more happy tomorrow, you don't need to switch.
